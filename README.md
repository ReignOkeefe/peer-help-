A Discord Bot that generates written feedback for a product spec.

All you have to do is give the link to the Notion page containing your product spec to our bot, and PEER will do the rest.

Created as part of the AI Camp Team Tomorrow Incubator Program to be used initially by the AI Camp Internal Tech Team in the AI Camp Discord.

Members include Blake Martin, Reign O'Keefe, Vamsee Cheruvu, Dylan Lim, Ian Kergott, and Amogh Janganure.
